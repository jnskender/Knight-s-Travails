# Knight's Travails
[View Project Requirements](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms)

In this project I create the necessary structures(Graphs) and algorithms to calculate the shortest path of a knight on a chess board to any given square on that board. I then display the steps the knight took to reach that path.

## Takeaways
* Learning to use graphs as a data structure outside of binary trees.
* I was able to neatly separate the functions of my code into what I think is good use of OOP
* I have learned that most of the process of completing such a project is only about 1/3 coding. The rest is going to the drawing board and working out the solution through psuedocode and sketches
* I am solidifying my process of
   1) Speaking the problem to better understand it
   2) Writing Psuedocode
   3) Solving problem
   4) Refactor/Optimization
